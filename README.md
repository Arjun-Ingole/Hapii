Hapii is a mobile application that connects NGOs and other similar organizations with volunteers who want to make a difference in their communities. The app allows NGOs to create profiles and post volunteer opportunities, while volunteers can search for and apply to these opportunities based on their interests and availability. Hapii also provides descriptions and contact information for each NGO, making it easy for volunteers to learn more about the organizations they want to work with.
